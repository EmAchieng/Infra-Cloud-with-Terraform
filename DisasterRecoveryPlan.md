# Disaster Recovery Plan for Terraform AWS Deployment Project

## Introduction

This document outlines the disaster recovery plan for this Terraform-managed AWS deployment project. The plan focuses on ensuring minimal downtime, protecting data integrity, and enabling rapid recovery in case of disruptions or disasters.

## Objectives

- **Minimize Downtime:** Ensure critical services are restored quickly to minimize operational impact.
- **Data Integrity:** Implement robust backup and recovery procedures to protect data.
- **Simplified Deployment:** Utilize Terraform for automated deployment and updates to maintain consistency.
- **Reusability:** Design infrastructure templates to facilitate easy replication and deployment of subsequent iterations.

## Infrastructure Overview

Our Terraform-managed AWS deployment includes:

- **AWS VPC:** Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets.
- **EC2 Instances:** Hosting applications such as Nginx for web serving.
- **Internet Gateway:** Provides secure internet access to resources within the VPC.
- **Route Tables and Security Groups:** Manage network routing and access control.

## Disaster Recovery Strategies

### Backup and Restore

- **Data Backup:**
  - Implement automated backups of critical data using Amazon S3.
  - Ensure backups include Terraform state files, configurations, and application data.

- **Database Backups:**
  - Enable point-in-time recovery to minimize data loss during outages.

### High Availability and Easy Deployment
- **Modular Infrastructure:**
  - Structured Terraform configurations that are into reusable modules for scalability and ease of deployment.
  - Parameterized modules to adapt configurations for different environments or iterations.

### System Recovery

1. **Assess the Cause of Downtime**: Identify the root cause of the system outage.
2. **Initiate Failover Procedures**:
    - Use Route 53 for DNS failover.
    - Utilize AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic to healthy instances.
3. **Repair the Primary System**:
    - For EC2: Replace or restart instances as necessary.
    - For RDS: Restore from a snapshot if the database instance is compromised.
    - For VPC: Check and restore network configurations.
4. **Test the System**: Ensure the primary system is fully operational before switching back from the backup.

### Security Measures

1. **Contain the Breach**: Isolate affected systems using security groups and NACLs.
2. **Assess the Impact**: Determine what data or systems were compromised.
3. **Initiate Incident Response**: Follow the incident response plan, including using AWS Config to investigate.
4. **Restore and Secure Systems**: Remove threats, restore systems from clean backups, update IAM policies, and review security groups.

### Disaster Recovery Testing
- **Automation and Monitoring:**
  - Utilize Terraform for automated deployment and configuration management to maintain consistency.
  - Implement monitoring and alerting to promptly detect failures and initiate recovery processes.
